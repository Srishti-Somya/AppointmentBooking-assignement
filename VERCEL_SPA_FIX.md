# Vercel Deployment Fix - SPA Routing Issue

## 🐛 Problem

Getting `404: NOT_FOUND` when accessing routes like `/register` directly on Vercel:
```
404: NOT_FOUND
Code: NOT_FOUND
ID: bom1::7vk8j-1754568187971-79b5e9371073
```

This happens because Vercel doesn't know how to handle client-side routes in Single Page Applications (SPAs).

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Added vercel.json Configuration

**Created**: `frontend/vercel.json`
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/service-worker.js",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration tells Vercel to:
- Route ALL requests (`(.*)`) to `index.html`
- Let React Router handle the client-side routing
- Properly cache service worker files

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub

Commit and push the new `vercel.json` file:
```bash
git add frontend/vercel.json
git commit -m "Add Vercel SPA routing configuration"
git push
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel

Vercel should automatically redeploy when you push. If not:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment

### 3. Verify Environment Variable

Make sure this is set in Vercel:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://appointmentbooking-backend-q31e.onrender.com/api
```

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

These URLs should now work:
- ✅ `https://your-app.vercel.app/`
- ✅ `https://your-app.vercel.app/login`
- ✅ `https://your-app.vercel.app/register`
- ✅ `https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard`
- ✅ `https://your-app.vercel.app/admin`

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **User visits** `/register` directly
2. **Vercel receives** the request
3. **vercel.json rewrite** sends `index.html` instead of 404
4. **React app loads** and React Router sees `/register`
5. **React Router** renders the RegisterForm component

## 🎯 Alternative Solutions

If the above doesn't work, you can also try:

### Option 1: _redirects file (Netlify-style)
Create `frontend/public/_redirects`:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### Option 2: Hash Router (Not recommended)
Change `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` in `main.tsx`:
```tsx
import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
// URLs would be /#/register instead of /register
```

## ✅ Expected Result

After this fix, your Vercel deployment should:
- ✅ Handle direct navigation to any route
- ✅ Preserve browser back/forward buttons
- ✅ Allow bookmarking of specific pages
- ✅ Work with React Router as expected

The SPA routing issue should be completely resolved! 🎉
